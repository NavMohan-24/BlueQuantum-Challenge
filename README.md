# BlueQuantum-Challenge
My Solutions based on Circuit Cutting to BlueQuantum's Challenge:

Task Details:

The goal is to “solve” as many of the 3 circuits (attached below) as possible. Each of the circuits prepares a state that has 1 bitstring with O(1) probability, while every other bitstring has a significantly (exponentially) smaller probability. Your task is to find the hidden bitstring for each of the 3 circuits.

Circuits are attached here as .qasm files.
